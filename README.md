## Hi there , I'm Evan 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer based in Yokohama, Japan. I love building applications from scratch and solving problems.

## 📋 Projects

[Kinjo](https://github.com/orgs/Kinjo-team/repositories) | [**Live Site**](https://www.kinjo-japan.com/): Kinjo is a travel app that empowers locals to catalogue hidden gems and local businesses in their neighbourhoods in an effort to promote community growth and sustainable travel.

Key Contributions:
   * **Attraction & Business Listing Tools**: Leveraged [React](https://react.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to develop intuitive user interfaces enabling users to search and list local attractions and businesses.
   * **Backend Data Management System**: Utilized [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) to implement a data management system for efficient storage and retrieval of local attractions and businesses.
   * **Cloud-Based Image Sharing**: Integrated Cloudinary to facilitate image sharing, allowing users to upload, store, and retrieve images, enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of local attraction listings.
   * **Interactive Commenting Feature**: Implemented a dynamic commenting system enabling users to engage, share insights, and provide feedback on various locations and catalogues of attractions.
   * **Stakeholder Communication & Product Ownership**: As the product owner, I spearheaded communication with stakeholders, ensuring their needs and feedback were accurately captured. Utilizing agile methodologies, I translated these requirements into actionable tasks, guiding the development team towards successful project milestones.


## 🌏 Open-Source Projects

[Find a Doc](https://github.com/ourjapanlife/findadoc-server): Find a Doc is a database to help foreign residents of Japan find healthcare in their native languages.

Key Contributions:
   * **Firestore Security Implementation**: Implemented secure protocols for [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore) to safeguard user information.
   * **Submission Review Workflow**: Modified the Firestore and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) integration to facilitate user data submissions, ensuring they undergo team review before being displayed on the website."
   * **Submission Management Tools**: Wrote GraphQL queries, mutations, and resolvers to implement CRUD functionality for moderators to manage user submitted data.
   * **Search Functionality Upgrades**: Used GraphQL and Firestore to optimize search algorithms, supporting advanced filtering and result limiting/ordering.
   * **Documentation Enhancement**: Provided step-by-step instructions for setting up the [Firebase Service Account](https://firebase.google.com/support/guides/service-accounts) and integrating it with the project environment.
   * **Testing for Submission Methods**: Utilized [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to introduce tests for submission methods, covering both standard (Happy Path) and error scenarios (Error Path).
   * **Submission Field Validation**: Implemented validation using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to ensure that submission fields are correctly provided.
